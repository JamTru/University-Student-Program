# Student Timetable Program

### Description
This program was written as part of an university assignment which involved writing a timetable program that would be used by university students for enrolling, withdrawing and viewing of a student's timetable. This was achieved by a Java program that incorporates an UI element that will display the courses as well as a rudimentary database system that stores a list of courses as well as student accounts. 
This project has been uploaded onto Github for the express purposes of display only and is not intended to be utilised in a serious application.
